         Please take note: there is a complicated chain of data passing here and I will explain it here

         This is the messaging mechanism for passing data from the push notification to the
         MainTableViewController
         AppDelegate > SplitViewController > SplitViewControllerPushDelegate > MainTableViewController

         Reason: This piece of code is run on a seperate thread that is different from the Main Thread.
         As a result, I cannot synchronously pass the data by setting some global property
         (which is bad practice in the first place)
         As such, a more complex messaging system was devised, based mostly on property observers and
         protocol/delegates was made to ensure relative robustness compaired to a global state.

         Steps:
         1. AppDelegate retrieves the feed item, assigns it as a property of the SplitViewController <-
         2. SplitViewController has a property observer on pushedFeedItem, which triggers a delegate call
         3. The MainTableViewController receives this delegate call, and initiates the segue
         */
        splitViewController.pushedFeedItem = payloadFeedItem
      } else {
        // Handle other types of push notifications here in the future
      }
    }
    return true
  }

  func applicationWillResignActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state.
    // This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an incoming phone
    // call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition
    // to the background state.
    // Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and invalidate graphics rendering
    // callbacks.
    // Games should use this method to pause the game.

  func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    // Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store
    // enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in
    // case it is terminated later.
    // If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of
    // applicationWillTerminate: when the user quits.
